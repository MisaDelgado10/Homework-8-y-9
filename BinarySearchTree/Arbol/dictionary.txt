  THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
Action of Second Continental Congress, July 4, 1776  The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America
WHEN in the Course of human Events,
it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which haveconnected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, theseparate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's Godentitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that theyshould declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, thatthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that amongthese are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness -- That to secure theseRights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers fromthe Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomesdestructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or toabolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on suchPrinciples, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem mostlikely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictatethat Governments long established should not be changed for light andtransient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind aremore disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselvesby abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train ofAbuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Designto reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty,to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their futureSecurity. Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; and such isnow the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems ofGovernment. The History of the present King of Great- Britain is a History ofrepeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object theEstablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, letFacts be submitted to a candid World.HE has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for thepublic Good.HE has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingImportance, unless suspended in their Operation till his Assent should beobtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.HE has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of large Districts ofPeople, unless those People would relinquish the Right of Representation inthe Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.HE has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual, uncomfortable,and distant from the Depository of their public Records, for the sole Purposeof fatiguing them into Compliance with his Measures.HE has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manlyFirmness his Invasions on the Rights of the People.HE has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to cause others to beelected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of the Annihilation, havereturned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in themean time exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion from without, and the
Convulsions within.HE has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purposeobstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass othersto encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of newAppropriations of Lands.HE has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent toLaws for establishing Judiciary Powers.HE has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of theirOffices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.HE has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officersto harrass our People, and eat out their Substance.HE has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consentof our Legislatures.HE has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to theCivil Power.HE has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to ourConstitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their Actsof pretended Legislation:FOR quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us;FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders whichthey should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:FOR cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:FOR imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:FOR transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:FOR abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province,establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, soas to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the sameabsolute Rules into these Colonies:FOR taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and alteringfundamentally the Forms of our Governments:FOR suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested withPower to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.HE has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection andwaging War against us.HE has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our Towns, and destroyedthe Lives of our People.HE is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries tocompleat the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun withcircumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most
barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.HE has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bearArms against their Country, to become the Executioners of their Friends andBrethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.HE has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bringon the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose knownRule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes andConditions.IN every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the mosthumble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeatedInjury. A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by every act which may definea Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren. We have warnedthem from Time to Time of Attempts by their Legislature to extend anunwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the Circumstancesof our Emigration and Settlement here. We have appealed to their nativeJustice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties of our commonKindred to disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt ourConnections and Correspondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice ofJustice and of Consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity,which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind,Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.WE, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATED OF AMERICA, in GENERALCONGRESS, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for theRectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the goodPeople of these Colonies, solemnly Publish and Declare, That these UnitedColonies are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that theyare absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all politicalConnection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to betotally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have fullPower to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, andto do all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. Andfor the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection ofdivine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes,and our sacred Honor.
